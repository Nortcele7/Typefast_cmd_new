We become what we think about
Life is what we make it always has been always will be
The best revenge is massive success
The mind is everything What you think you become
Believe you can and you are halfway there
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago The second best time is now
The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be
Fall seven times and stand up eight
Everything has beauty but not everyone can see
Happiness is not something readymade It comes from your own actions
If the wind will not serve take to the oars
You become what you believe
Dream big and dare to fail
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop
Change your thoughts and you change your world
